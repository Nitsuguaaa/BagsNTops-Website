{"description":"FUTURISTIC SLIDES THAT ARE MADE WITH NATURE. For the design of these adidas slides we looked to topographic maps illustrating expeditions to Mars and the dimensional stages of a new planet. And the futuristic vibes don't end there. They're built with material made in part from sugarcane, one step on the road to a more sustainable future. Wear them on diverse terrain from wet to dry. These slides are made with natural and renewable materials as part of our journey to design out finite resources and help end plastic waste.
